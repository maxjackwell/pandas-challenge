Mod 4 Challenge
Summary: 
    The following data analyzes a wealth of information from two datasets combined into one. Our new singular dataset offers up information about students and their schools. For the students it's their school / reading and math scores. For the schools it's their size and budget. Included information will be District wide statistics, individual School Summaries, School-Year grade breakdowns, and grade breakdowns based on the budget and size of schools.

Analysis:
    1. When looking at the DataFrame comparing School Size to Students' Scores, there is a link between the size of a school and the grades the students get. Although this conclusions stands for both subjects as a whole, I'd like to focus specificailly on the "Percent Passing Math" statiscitcs. There is a strong correlation between students performing poorly, less than 70% passing, on their math classes when attending large schools. When the schools have lower student populations, the students perform much better in math classes, leaping to upwards of a 90% passing rate. A natural conclusion would be that if you wish to have success in the classroom, in this district, one should look to join a school with a smaller student body.

    2. When assessing the DataFrame comparing Types of Schools to Students' Scores, another correlation is found. Across the board, Charter schools are outpeforming District schools on all student statistics. The best example of that is over 90% of students are passing both math and reading at Charter schools, but at District schools this figure falls below 55%. The natural conclusion here is that the type of school you choose is linked to success rate in the classroom and choosing a Charter school instead of a District school will lead to better chances to perform well.

During this challenge I used both my U of M tutor, the AskBCS tutor and the X-pert Learning Assistant.

These are all of the websites that I used to complete this challenge:
